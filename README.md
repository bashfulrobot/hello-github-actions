## Welcome to "Hello World" with GitHub Actions

This course will walk you through writing your first action and using it with a workflow file. 

**Ready to get started? Navigate to the first issue.**

### My Notes

* The output does not show in the logfile in the interface.
* Search does find instances from the output.
* But if you view the raw log, ctrl-f does find it. So the action was successful.
